# Wii U tower defense homebrew game

I wanted to make a tower defense homebrew game for the Wii U. It uses devKitPro wut and the OSScreen API.

## Playing the game

**Using a Wii U console:** [Install CFW](https://wiiu.hacks.guide), go to the [latest workflow run](https://github.com/MatthewL246/wiiu-tower-defense/actions/workflows/cmake.yml?query=branch%3Amain), download and unzip the build artifact, and copy the `wiiu-tower-defense.rpx` and `wiiu-tower-defense.wuhb` files over to your SD card at `/wiiu/apps/`.

**Using a PC:** [Download the Cemu emulator](https://cemu.info/#download), go to the [latest workflow run](https://github.com/MatthewL246/wiiu-tower-defense/actions/workflows/cmake.yml?query=branch%3Amain), download and unzip the build artifact, and drag and drop the `wiiu-tower-defense.rpx` file onto the Cemu window.
